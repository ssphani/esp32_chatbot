"OpenAI_STT_Client.h" with the actual library provided by OpenAI or a third-party for OpenAI STT. Additionally, replace "API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.

If OpenAI doesn't provide a dedicated STT service, you may need to explore other STT services such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe, or other available alternatives that provide APIs for speech recognition. Always refer to the documentation or resources provided by the respective service for accurate and up-to-date information.
